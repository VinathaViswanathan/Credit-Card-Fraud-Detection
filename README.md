# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project tackles the real-world problem of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. Given the extreme class imbalance (fraudulent transactions represent only 0.17% of the data), the project carefully preprocesses, analyzes, and models the data using various classification algorithms.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Build and compare the performance of multiple machine learning models to accurately classify credit card transactions as fraudulent (1) or non-fraudulent (0).

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
1. Source: creditcard.csv (Kaggle)
2. Total records: 284,807
3. Fraudulent transactions: 492 (0.17%)
4. Features: 30 (V1â€“V28 are anonymized PCA components, plus Amount, Time, and Class)

## ðŸ”§ Steps Followed
Data Import & Preprocessing
1. Removed Time column (not useful for modeling)
2. Scaled Amount feature using StandardScaler

Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Identified extreme class imbalance
2. Analyzed amount statistics across fraud and non-fraud cases

Feature Selection & Splitting
1. X: All features except Class
2. y: Target variable (Class)
3. Train-test split: 80% train / 20% test
